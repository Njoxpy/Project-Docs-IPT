# Project Overview: Digital Logbook System

## What the Project Does
The Digital Logbook System is designed to streamline the process of recording, managing, and reviewing Industrial Practical Training (IPT) activities. It replaces traditional paper-based logbooks with an online platform that offers several features:

- **Logbook Entry**: Allows students to record daily or weekly IPT activities, including the date, description of tasks, hours worked, and any comments.
- **Supervisor Feedback**: Enables supervisors to review and provide feedback on student entries, ensuring they are on the right track.
- **Report Generation**: Generates comprehensive reports of all recorded activities for submission to university authorities.
- **User Management**: Handles different user roles such as students, supervisors, and administrators.
- **Notifications**: Sends reminders and notifications to students for timely entry submissions and to supervisors for pending reviews.

## User Case

### Students
- **Logbook Entry**: Students log into the system to record their daily or weekly IPT activities.
