Functional Requirements User Authentication Users can register and log in. Password recovery functionality. Logbook Entry Students can create, edit, and delete logbook entries. Entries include date, description of activities, and time spent. Supervisor Feedback Supervisors can review student entries. Supervisors can leave comments and approve entries. Reporting Generate basic reports on student progress and activities. Non-Functional Requirements Performance: The system should handle up to 500 concurrent users(bado!!!!!1). Security: Data should be encrypted in transit and at rest. Usability: The system should be user-friendly and accessible on desktop and mobile browsers. Accessibilitybility: The System should be user friendly to be accessible by all types of people inclduing people with disability. Use Cases User Registration Actor: Student Scenario: A student registers for a new account. Steps: Navigate to the registration page. Fill in the registration form with name(registration number), email, and password. Submit the form. Receive a confirmation email and activate the account. On registration I will instead use sims for enabling user to login with SIMS account.Integrating with SIMS. Create Logbook Entry Actor: Student Scenario: A student creates a new logbook entry.
